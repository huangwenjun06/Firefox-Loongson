 * We often want to run tasks on a target that guarantees that events will never
 * run in parallel. There are various target types that achieve this - namely
 * nsIThread and MediaTaskQueue. Note that nsIThreadPool (which implements
 * nsIEventTarget) does not have this property, so we do not want to use
 * nsIEventTarget for this purpose. This class encapsulates the specifics of
 * the structures we might use here and provides a consistent interface.
 *
 * At present, the supported AbstractThread implementations are MediaTaskQueue
 * and AbstractThread::MainThread. If you add support for another thread that is
 * not the MainThread, you'll need to figure out how to make it unique such that
 * comparing AbstractThread pointers is equivalent to comparing nsIThread pointers.
